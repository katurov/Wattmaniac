## Before you go

If connected to a 20W or higher power source, your MagSafe Battery Pack can charge your iPhone with up to 15W of power.

In order to get 7.5W charging on the go, update your MagSafe Battery Pack to the latest firmware. The firmware update begins automatically after you attach your battery pack to your iPhone. The firmware update can take about one week.

## Charging phone via MagSafe Battery Pack

I have iPhone 13 and it was short test, but it helps to understand:
* on 62% of the phone the fully charged battery consumes 9V 1.29A (11.42W)
* on 73% - 9V 1.23A (10.15W)

Never saw 15W but it seems possible
